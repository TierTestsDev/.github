# TierTests Network

Welcome to the official GitHub organisation for **[TierTests](https://tiertests.com)** 🎮  

We build and maintain the infrastructure behind:
- 🌐 [tiertests.com](https://tiertests.com) — our web platform for Minecraft tier testing
- 💬 [discord.gg/tiertests](https://discord.gg/tiertests) — [1.8] Tier Tests community Discord
- 💬 [discord.gg/tests](https://discord.gg/tests) — [1.9+] Tier Tests community Discord

## 🧩 What is TierTests?
TierTests is a competitive **Minecraft PvP tier testing** system designed for both:
- **1.8 PvP** — legacy combat
- **1.9+ PvP** — modern combat mechanics  

Our goal is to provide a fair and transparent environment where players can demonstrate skill, climb ranks, and take part in community-driven tier placements.

## 🔗 Account Linking
We use a **registration system** to securely connect:
- Your **Minecraft account**

This ensures accurate player identity across both the website and Discord servers.
